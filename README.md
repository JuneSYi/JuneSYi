<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm June</h1>
<h3 align="center">On a journey to escape imposter syndrome</h3>

ðŸ”­ I attended a backend-focused software bootcamp back in 2022 where I first picked up Java and then spent a year as a DevOps Engineer working with AWS infrastructure. After moving to the Bay Area in 2023, I'm now working on telecommunication data and networks--looking to eventually transition to a software/tech company in the near future.

ðŸ’¬ AMA about **Military life, Software Dev bootcamps, learning to code**

ðŸ’¬ Would love to talk about:
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Career progression**
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :game_die: **All-in Podcast**
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :rocket: **AI / ML - Huggingface, LangChain, OpenAI**
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :eyes: The Bay Area culture...

ðŸ“« How to best reach me **JYTechDevOps@gmail.com** or message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/junesyi"> LinkedIn </a>

âš¡ Fun fact: :black_joker: My original plan after leaving the military was to go full time in poker! Always happy to chat about NLHE or PLO :)
