<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm June</h1>
<h3 align="center">On a journey to escape imposter syndrome</h3>

🔭 I attended a backend development focused bootcamp back in 2022 where I first picked up Java. I, then, spent a year as a DevOps Engineer developing microservices in AWS Cloud and learning the fundamentals of backend infrastructure. After moving to the Bay Area in 2023, I'm now working with Evolved Packet Core and other related telecommunication networks.

💬 AMA about **Military life, Software Dev bootcamps, learning to code**

💬 Would love to talk about:
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Career progression**
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :game_die: **All-in Podcast**

📫 How to best reach me **JYTechDevOps@gmail.com** or message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/junesyi"> LinkedIn </a>

⚡ Fun fact: :black_joker: My original plan after leaving the military was to go full time in poker! Always happy to chat about NLHE or PLO :)
