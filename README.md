<h3 align="center">On a journey to escape imposter syndrome</h3>

ðŸ”­ I attended a backend-focused software bootcamp back in 2021 where I first picked up Java and then spent a year as a DevOps Engineer working with AWS infrastructure. I'm currently focused mainly on leetcode and passively learning Rust on the side

:eyes: if my git activity looks dissapointingly empty, trust me, I'm on the same page. It's been a struggle trying to decide what's the right thing to focus on. I ended up choose data structures, https://leetcode.com/u/junesyi/, and am now aiming for a balance between both.

ðŸ’¬ AMA about **Military life, Software Dev bootcamps, learning to code**

ðŸ’¬ Would love to talk about:
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Career progression/journey**
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :game_die: **All-in Podcast**
<br> &emsp; &emsp; :rocket: **Coding, Backend, System Design, DSA, System programming languages--anything tech related**
