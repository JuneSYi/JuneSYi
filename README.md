<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm June</h1>
<h3 align="center">On a journey to escape imposter syndrome</h3>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on picking up ~~Angular~~ React as my first frontend framework. If you're curious to see what I've done, you can find my work here in the <a href= "https://github.com/JuneSYi/React"> React folder </a>.

ðŸ”­ That line above restarted my determination to get back into algo practice. I started a daily habit of doing some <a href= "https://github.com/JuneSYi/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms"> Data Structures and Algorithms </a>. My personal goal is to aim for 1 per day for the rest of 2023 (today is 5/1/2023). I'll use my github contributions graph to keep myself honest.

âš¡ Fun fact: :runner: I was so nervous for my first marathon that I ran a marathon (on my own, using GPS) a week before in order to see if it was possible and to avoid embarassment if I failed (the plan was to back out if that was the case).
